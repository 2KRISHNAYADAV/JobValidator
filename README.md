## 🛠 How It Works
Our advanced algorithm analyzes multiple aspects of job postings to identify potential fraud.

### 2️⃣ Step 2: Metadata Verification

- Company Verification
- Location Analysis
- Contact Validation

## ⚠️ Common Warning Signs
Be on the lookout for these red flags when reviewing job opportunities:

🚩 **Too Good To Be True** - Unusually high salary for minimal qualifications or experience, promises of quick wealth, or extremely flexible arrangements.

🚩 **Vague Job Description** - Lack of specific job duties, required skills, or company details. Legitimate employers provide clear information about the role.

🚩 **Unprofessional Communication** - Emails or messages with poor grammar, spelling errors, or generic greetings like "Dear Applicant" instead of your name.

🚩 **Requests for Personal Information** - Early requests for sensitive data like your SSN, bank account details, or copies of identification documents before a formal interview.

🚩 **Payment Required** - Any request for payment for training, equipment, or registration fees is a major red flag for job scams.

🚩 **Pressure Tactics** - Creating urgency to accept the offer quickly without time to research the company or position thoroughly.
